# 3d-regressions
Simple regressions can easily be visualized in 2 dimensions; regressions with 2 explanatory variables can be visualized using interactive 3 dimensional visuals. These 3 dimensional interactive visuals provide statisticians and data analysts a new method to interpret a variety of different common types of regressions.

This kind of visualization often takes a little bit of practice to learn to interpret. The first section of this document introduces these three dimensional visuals and how to interpret them. This includes understanding the data points, regression surfaces, and marginal effects. Each subsequent section of this document uses 3 dimensional visuals to provide insights into an additional type of regression model commonly used by statisticians and data analysts. The types of regressions include:

  - nested models (Section 2)
  - regressions with interaction terms (Section 3)
  - regressions with categorical variables (Section 4)
  - regressions with categorical where intersectionality is relevant
  - two stage least squares and regressions with instrumental variables
  
These visuals can be used by instructors of statistical methods and data analysis. Instructors currently commonly provide visual representations for simple regressions. When multiple regressions are visualized in classroom settings, they are often demonstrated using a flat hand or a sheet of paper to represent the regression surface, along with gestures and verbal explanations to provide insights. This document provides a series of interactive visuals that can be used and distributed to students to aid their understanding of multiple regression. An R package called DiRA, which stands for Directional Regression Analysis and provides the tools to create these 3 dimensional regression surfaces, is forthcoming.

The insights are limited to 3 dimensional models; i.e. those with only 2 explanatory variables. Visualizing four dimensions is not nearly as practical in our three dimensional world. Nonetheless, the insights connect simple regression to multiple regressions in ways that provide some additional intuition into the connections between any lower order and higher order model.
